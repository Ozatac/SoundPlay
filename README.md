## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - Declarative way to bind data to UI layout.
  - [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Fragment routing handler. (Upcoming)

- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android apps.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading.
- [Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) -  logs HTTP request and response data.


## Architectures

MVVM

We follow Google recommended [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) to structure our architecture based on MVVM, reactive UI using LiveData / RxJava observables and data binding.

* **View**: Activity/Fragment with UI-specific logics only.
* **ViewModel**: It keeps the logic away from View layer, provides data streams for UI and handle user interactions.
* **Model**: Repository pattern, data layers that provide interface to manipulate data from both the local and remote data sources. The local data sources will serve as [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth).
